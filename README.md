# RoboAdvisor for suggesting Investment Portfolio

In this assignment, we will build a Roboadvisor, using AWS Lex and AWS Lambda, that will suggest an investment portfolio for retirement based on user input.

**The steps followed are:

1. Configure the initial bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.
2. Build and test the robo advisor to make sure that the bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user.
3. Enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. 
Packages Used This project leverages python 3.7, AWS Lex and AWS Lambda
